## Part B: Format <br>

### Proposal 建議書 <br>

#### Greeting <br>

Dear Sir/Madam, <br>

#### Opening <br>

Start with a firm introduction <br>
This should start out with a hook (應先勾引讀者的注意力). Ideally, you want your readers enraptured (被吸引) from point one. Make your proposal as purposeful and useful as possible. Use some background information to get your readers in the zone. Then state the purpose of your proposal. <br>

#### Body <br>

State the problem <br>

Here's where you should state your problem. If your readers don't know much about the circumstance, fill them in. Think of this as the "state of affairs" section of your proposal (當作交代事態發展). What is the problem? What is causing the problem? What effects does this problem have? <br>

Emphasize why your problem needs to be solved and needs to be solved now. How will it affect your audience if left alone? Make sure to answer all questions and cover them with research and facts. Use credible sources liberally. <br>

Propose solutions <br>

The solutions section is where you get into how you will address the problem, why you will do it in this way, and what the outcomes will be. To make sure you've got a persuasive proposal (確保你的建議有説服力的), think about the following: <br>

The larger impact of your ideas (提出的建議有多大的影響力). Ideas that seem of limited applicability aren't as likely to spark enthusiasm in readers as ideas that could have widespread effects. (較少影響力啲建議較低機會激發讀者的熱情，並不能産生廣泛的影響)  <br>

Example: "Greater knowledge of tuna behavior can allow us to create a more comprehensive management strategy and ensure canned tuna for future generations." <br>

Addressing why you will do something is as important as stating what you will do.  Presume that your readers are skeptical and will not accept your ideas at face value. If you're proposing to do a catch-and-release study of 2, 000 wild tuna, why? <br>

#### Closing <br>

Wrap up and restate main points <br>
Mirror your introduction, succinctly wrapping up your general message (參考介紹段落，簡單總結文章的要點). If there are consequences to your proposal not being undertaken, address them. Summarize the benefits of your proposal and drive home that the benefits outweigh the costs (帶出文章的建議好處多於弊處以作總結). Leave your audience thinking ahead. And, as always, thank them for their consideration and time. <br>

#### Sign off <br>

(Date) <br>
(Receiver’s address) <br>

#### Greeting <br>

Dear Sir/Madam, <br>

#### Opening <br>

Sum up the purpose of writing the letter in one line. This helps the receiver focus on the subject of the letter in one glance (幫助讀者的焦點集中在書信的主題上). It is important to underline the subject.  <br>

#### Body <br>

This is the main content of the letter. It is either divided into three paragraphs or two paragraphs if the letter is briefer. The tone of the content should be formal. Do not use any offensive language (不要用任何冒犯性的語言). Another point to be kept in mind is that the letter should be concise and to the point. And always be respectful and considerate in your language.

Short introduction paragraph: Provide details about the product or service that is the subject of the complaint. Include dates, location and the specifications about the item or service. <br>

### Reports 報告 <br>

#### Title <br>

Title summarising the event / project / topic the report will be based on, this includes the name of the author(s) and the date of report preparation. <br>

#### Summary <br>

There needs to be a summary of the major points, conclusions, and recommendations. It needs to be short as it is a general overview of the report. Some people will read the summary and only skim the report (部份人只會閲讀概要並快速地掃視內文), so make sure you include all the relevant information. It would be best to write this last so you will include everything, even the points that might be added at the last minute. <br>

#### Intro <br>

The first page of the report needs to have an introduction. You will explain the problem and show the reader why the report is being made. You need to give a definition of terms if you did not include these in the title section and explain how the details of the report are arranged.   <br>

#### Body <br>

This is the main section of the report. There needs to be divided into several sections, each having a subtitle. Information is usually arranged in order of importance (以重要程度分先後) with the most important information coming first.  <br>

#### Closing <br>

This is where everything comes together. Summarise points you have made. Keep this section free of jargon as most people will read the Summary and Conclusion (因大部份人只會閲讀概要和結尾，所以盡量減少或免去較深的詞彙).     <br>

Ask for readers to leave a comment or share their thoughts <br>

### Speech 演講辭 <br>

#### Opening <br>

Choose a hook to grab the audience’s attention right away (應先勾引觀眾的注意力). <br>

For example, if you are writing a motivational speech about weight loss, then you might say something like, “Five years ago, I could not walk up a flight of stairs without needing to take a break halfway up.” <br>

#### Body <br>

Address each of your main points in a logical order.  <br>

After introducing your topic and providing context, launch right into your points. State each point clearly and offer additional information, evidence, facts, and statistics to explain each of your points. Plan to devote about 1 paragraph to each of your points. <br>

Include transitions (轉折語) to guide your audience through your speech <br>

Then <br>
Next <br>
Before <br>
After <br>
First <br>
Second <br>
In that moment <br>
The following week <br>

#### Closing <br>

Conclude your speech with a call-to-action (以呼籲觀眾採取行動作總結). As you near the end of your speech, your audience should be excited by your topic and ready to act.  <br>

Encourage your audience to find out more and participate in a solution to the problem you have described by telling them how they can do so. This is a great opportunity to share resources with your audience and to give them some direction for how they can participate (為觀眾提供可行的方向以參與你所提出的行動). <br>

#### Sign off <br>

End with a powerful, short sentence that is likely to stick in the audience's minds (以一句強而有力的句子作為演廣的未句，最好可以牢牢抓住觀眾的心). <br>

### Letter to the editor 讀者投稿 <br>

#### Opening <br>

* `Proposal 建議書`

`Greeting`

Dear Sir/Madam, 

`Opening`

Start with a firm introduction
This should start out with a hook (應先勾引讀者的注意力). Ideally, you want your readers enraptured (被吸引) from point one. Make your proposal as purposeful and useful as possible. Use some background information to get your readers in the zone. Then state the purpose of your proposal.

`Body`

State the problem

Here's where you should state your problem. If your readers don't know much about the circumstance, fill them in. Think of this as the "state of affairs" section of your proposal (當作交代事態發展). What is the problem? What is causing the problem? What effects does this problem have?

Emphasize why your problem needs to be solved and needs to be solved now. How will it affect your audience if left alone? Make sure to answer all questions and cover them with research and facts. Use credible sources liberally.

Propose solutions
The solutions section is where you get into how you will address the problem, why you will do it in this way, and what the outcomes will be. To make sure you've got a persuasive proposal (確保你的建議有説服力的), think about the following:

The larger impact of your ideas (提出的建議有多大的影響力). Ideas that seem of limited applicability aren't as likely to spark enthusiasm in readers as ideas that could have widespread effects. (較少影響力啲建議較低機會激發讀者的熱情，並不能産生廣泛的影響) 

Example: "Greater knowledge of tuna behavior can allow us to create a more comprehensive management strategy and ensure canned tuna for future generations."

Addressing why you will do something is as important as stating what you will do.  Presume that your readers are skeptical and will not accept your ideas at face value. If you're proposing to do a catch-and-release study of 2,000 wild tuna, why?

`Closing`

Wrap up and restate main points
Mirror your introduction, succinctly wrapping up your general message (參考介紹段落，簡單總結文章的要點). If there are consequences to your proposal not being undertaken, address them. Summarize the benefits of your proposal and drive home that the benefits outweigh the costs (帶出文章的建議好處多於弊處以作總結). Leave your audience thinking ahead. And, as always, thank them for their consideration and time.
